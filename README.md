# Nanocomposites
Each entry in the database represents a nanocomposite with its measured properties. The input variables (or features) include:
P1: The size of nanomaterials  (S)\\
P2: Tensile strength (T)\\
P3: Flexural Strength (F)
P4: Temperature (TM)
P5: Concentration (CO)
The output variable "Conductivity (C)" is divided into predefined categories: Good, Medium, and Bad. These classes facilitate a classification of nanocomposites based on their property values.
#  Data Normalization
Before using this database, it can be normalized. Each property should be adjusted based on its mean and standard deviation, which optimizes it for machine learning models by reducing scale variations and improving convergence during training.
#  Objective
The primary objective is to provide an organized dataset for training and evaluating nanocomposite classification models, thereby offering insights into the impact of nanoparticles on material properties.
